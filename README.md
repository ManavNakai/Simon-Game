# Simon-Game

Simon-Game is a web-based version of the classic memory skill game, Simon. Originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978, the game challenges players to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of tones and lights. This project uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery to recreate the game, adding interactivity and sound effects to test the user's short-term memory.

## Project Overview
The Simon-Game project replicates the popular memory game where users must remember and repeat sequences of tones and lights. The sequences become progressively longer and more challenging as the game continues. If the user fails to reproduce the sequence correctly, the game is over.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content on the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic and interactivity.
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can interact with the game by clicking buttons to repeat the sequences.
- **Sound Effects**: Each button press is accompanied by a unique tone to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The sequences become longer and more complex as the user successfully repeats them.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is playable on various devices and screen sizes.
